7th Sea RnK support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a special support for RnK mechanics. The base form is '5k2', it shows
all kept dice and their sum. Exploded dice are shown as result numbers (23 for
10+10+3, for example). A static modifier may be applied to the total sum using
'5k2+2' or '5k2-2'. '-' prefix disables explosion of 10's, '+' prefix enables
printing of unkept dice. If you want to disable explosion and to print unkept
dice, you can use '-5kk2' ('5kk2' is identical to '+5k2'). Attempts to roll
and/or keep more than 10 dice are resolved according to Player's Guide,
wrapping excess dice from unkept to kept and from kept to the static modifier.
You can roll the same combination several times using, for example, '3#5k2'.
